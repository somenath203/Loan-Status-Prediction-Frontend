# Loan Status Prediction Frontend

This is a website built with the help of NextJS, TailwindCSS, and antd. This website is used to predict whether a particular applicant is eligible to get loan or not. The website is connected with a machine learning model built on top of RandomForestClassifier with the help of FastAPI and with the help of this model, the website makes predictions about the eligibility of an applicant for getting the loan.
